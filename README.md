Working on building a Piano-Tiles inspired tool to help me learn Hindi. 

Core functionality
- Scrape Hindi songs 
- Play music in background
- Use Google Cloud Speech to Text AI to split into words
- Sing/speak words with it
- Swipe through what you missed (and you can play the word-audio again)
     - Keep on doing it until AI says you are ready to go!
